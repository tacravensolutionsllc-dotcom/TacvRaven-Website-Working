Our AI system is responsible for the original discovery of all twelve, each found and responsibly disclosed to the OpenSSL team during the fall and winter of 2025. Of those, 10 were assigned CVE-2025 identifiers and 2 received CVE-2026 identifiers. Adding the 10 to the three we already found in the ...</p></blockquote>",

      "description": "<p>Here are three papers describing different side-channel attacks against LLMs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2410.17175v1\">Remote Timing Attacks on Efficient Language Model Inference</a>&#8220;:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Scaling up language models has significantly increased their capabilities. But larger models are slower models, and so there is now an extensive body of work (e.g., speculative sampling or parallel decoding) that improves the (average case) efficiency of language model generation. But these techniques introduce data-dependent timing characteristics. We show it is possible to exploit these timing differences to mount a timing attack. By monitoring the (encrypted) network traffic between a victim user and a remote language model, we can learn information about the content of messages by noting when responses are faster or slower. With complete black-box access, on open source systems we show how it is possible to learn the topic of a user&#8217;s conversation (e.g., medical advice vs. coding assistance) with 90%+ precision, and on production systems like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT and Anthropic&#8217;s Claude we can distinguish between specific messages or infer the user&#8217;s language. We further show that an active adversary can leverage a boosting attack to recover PII placed in messages (e.g., phone numbers or credit card numbers) for open source systems. We conclude with potential defenses and directions for future work...</p></blockquote>",
